## Game Layout:

At the start of the game, the user will press "START" to start the game.
Upon clicking "START", a ball will be dropped from the corner of the ceiling. 
The user uses the arrow keys (left & right) to hit the ball.
The user has three lives and a timer.
If the user lets a ball passed his paddle, the user will lose a life.
The timer will reset once it reaches 0.
100 points will be awarded everytime the timer is reset.
A new ball will then be spawned.
Once the user loses all three lives, 
the user will see a "GAME OVER" text.
